## accounts-saml-shibboleth

SAML v2 login support for existing password based accounts using Shibboleth IdP

### Important Notes

This package is working with testShib.org IdP, but has not been tested with any other IdPs  
This package is expecting an encrypted assertion  

### Usage

put saml settings in meteor.settings like so:  

    {
      "public": {
        "debug": true,
      },
      "bUseTestShib": true,
      "saml":[{
        "provider":"shibboleth-idp",
        "profile": {
          "firstName": "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/givenname",
          "lastName" : "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/surname"
        },
        "authFields":{
          "fname": "uid",
          "dbField": "username"
        },
        "pem": "-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----SomeKeyHere-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----",
        "entryPoint":"https://shibboleth.uwyo.edu/idp/profile/SAML2/Redirect/SSO",
        "issuer": "https://www.yourdomain.com/shibboleth-sp",
        "cert":"remove -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- at the beginning and -----END CERTIFICATE----- at the end"
     }]
    }



Note:  debug = true will create a table that has log errors in it.  The authFields fname is the friendlyName of attribute in saml assertion and dbField only can be username or UWID right now.  AuthFields is optional, you can remove authFields and it will default to emails.address as the dbField and the email in the assertion for the login process.


Then in some template add a button with click event that will call:

    'click .saml-login': function(event, template) {
        var provider = "some-provider";
        Meteor.loginWithSaml({
            provider: provider
        }, function(error, result) {
            //handle errors and result
        });
    },
